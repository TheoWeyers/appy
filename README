Installation:

1) Open a terminal in the folder containing the app.js file
2) Run the command: npm install express
3) Start the program by running the command: node app.js

* NB Nodejs has to be installed on the PC, can download it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Usage:

Make a get request to http://localhost:80/v1/calculateCompatibility
with parameters
firstName
secondName


Notes:
Calculator 2 and 3 are unimplemented at this stage, they simply return 0

Assumptions:
    The aggregator will set the weight = 1 if only one input argument is provided, only two names are accepted as inputs, beacuse the second and thrid calculator is unimplemented
    The aggregator function is called with only one input since only calculator 1 has been implemented, the line 
    // var result             = this.aggregator(classicCompResultNorm,oceanCompResultNorm,dimorphicResultNorm) should be used when the other calculators have been implemented

Future Dev:
    Implement Calculator 2 and 3
    Create UI
    Dockerize the application for easy cloud deployment
    Implement error logs
